>**SP Engineering Academy Year 2, Sem 2, Engineering Realisation Project**
- [x] Discuss about our Problem Statement,Features,Reasons(mainly 3 reasons for the society)& who.
- [x] Everyone learn about Markdown Guide
- [ ] Meet up frequently to do our prototype during the Holidays (so that we dont do last minute)
- [ ] Presentation Slides & Prototype ready to show off
- [ ] Ready to Impress Everyone!!

## Week 1 (14/10/19 - 20/10/19):
### Brainstorming Session:
Initial ideas:
1. Deliver food in kitchen (due to oil in floor)
2. Automatic ward bed (less stress for nurses)
3. Stable rescue stretcher (reduce unnecessary movement of casualty)
4. Grab rubbish (easier for cleaners)
5. Exploration under river (Help with further experiment)
6. Construction site (transport of loads and construction materials due to loose and uneven soil)

Features:
1. Suspension (Better ground traction)
2. Carry load
3. Controllable
4. Lightweight

How we brainstorm our ideas (based on): 
Demographics
Types of terrain
Situations

According to the picture above, we have narrowed down to 4 ideas, a tree planting machine, a partially autonomous stretcher, an autonomous first aid delivery drone, and an ice depth sensing robot.

After considering the 4 aforementioned ideas, we decided to go with the ice depth sensing robot. This is because we want to create something that can phase out the traditional methods of testing the depth of frozen ice paths to determine if it's safe to walk. The current methods mostly include a person to manually drill holes in the ice to check for the depth, which is often quite dangerous if there is a mistep as the person my accidentally walk on thin ice and fall into a pool of freezing water.

This will benefit society by:
1. Allowing people to safely play on ice without risk of death
2. Prevents harm from people checking ice
3. Can be modified such that it can be a subsitute to prevent deaths from landmines

Hence, our idea can benefit the society by automating or quickening the process of checking the depths of ice.
Its features include:
1. An ultrasonic depth scanner
2. Remote controllable
3. Able to work in extreme cold
4. Able to move well on ice

## Week 2 (21/10/19 - 27/10/19):  
### Week 2 Assignment-
1. Download python editor (found in group info), cher recommend thonny
2. Make the space invader game 
3. Go to youtube
--> search for thonny, then look for 2 tutorial videos, and document them, 2points why the vid is good, and 2points why the vid is bad
4. Write down what u learnt in python 
-->what errors yall faced
-->your trials and errors
-->what yall

## Week 3 (28/10/19 - 3/11/19):

We were given the mini T100 track vehicle to assemble and do our initial prototyping. We got this model from [aliexpres](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32799533790.html).

### Assembly
